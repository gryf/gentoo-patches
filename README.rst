Gentoo patches
==============

Just some simple customizations for packages which doesn't need to modify their
ebuilds.

To install, just go to ``/etc/portage/patches`` (or make that directory if it
doesn't exists) and clone this repo into it, like:

.. code:: shell-session

   cd /etc/portage/patches
   git clone https://github.com/gryf/gentoo-patches .

as a root.
